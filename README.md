### Introduction
`template.zip` is a .zip archive file containing a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and a `data` folder. 

`notebook.ipynb`: This is the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code and explanations for the project. To open it locally, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer.

`data` folder: This folder contains the datasets that are used in the .ipynb file. The datasets are in various formats, such as .csv, .txt, etc.
