-   [ ] Appropriate use of clean/dirty data?
    
-   [ ] Commercially focused?
    

### Description

-   [ ] Highlights the problem(s) learners will solve?
    
-   [ ] Mentions relevant technologies, e.g., popular packages used (optional)?
    

### Instructions

-   [ ] 200-1000 characters?
    
-   [ ] States the name(s) and quality parameter(s) of any required variable(s)?
